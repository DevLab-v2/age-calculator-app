## What I Focused in this Project

**JavaScript**: I gained experience in manipulating the DOM, handling events, and performing calculations based on user input. I also learned how to handle date and time in JavaScript, which was crucial for the age calculation feature of this app.

**Problem Solving**: This project challenged me to think critically about how to implement the age calculation feature. I learned how to break down the problem into smaller tasks and tackle each one systematically.
